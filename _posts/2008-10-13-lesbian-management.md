I had an interesting experience at work today.  My full time supervisor's boss's boss (that's a lot of apostrophes) showed up for a visit today.  Now I only saw her briefly walking towards me, and then I guess she had something else to do so she turned around and walked away.  Shortly afterwords a coworker said to me, "Have you noticed how all the full time female managers here seem to be lesbians?"  We then discussed the reasons why this might be the case.  I want to present some of our explanations here.
The first thought that occurred to me was that a straight female would probably be married, and hence she would spend her time at home with her children, rather than devoting most of her life to the company.  A lesbian on the other hand, has no such commitment, she can easily dedicate a good sixty to eighty hours a week to her profession (and that is how much time full time management types dedicate to the company).  This was my first thought.
Another coworker had a different explanation.  It was in his opinion that the reason why, was because lesbians were the only females tough enough to survive that long to become full time management in the company.  I personally figured this was stereotyping lesbians as manlike, and didn't fully agree.  Though I must admit that most of the lesbians I have met do tend to act and dress with boyishness.
This actually got me thinking about the glass ceiling, and I wondered if you had to behave in a manlike manner in order to break through, and that is why only lesbians seemed to be in upper management.  Or maybe they aren't lesbians at all, they just seem that way because of their toughness (this relating back to the stereotype, however).
Thus were my thoughts concerning the matter.  I'm not really sure why so many female managers are lesbians, and it is possible that they aren't lesbians at all, and that they just come off that way.
