Rough Concept will drastically change in a few months. Rough Concept will become a traditional blog, containing observations, comments, reviews, rants, and so forth. Short stories, essays, poetry, and other writings by Jack Everett will still be featured on the website, but they will be separate from the blog entries, and they will be provided in PDF format so that Mr. Everett can format them in the way he wants them to be read. At that time Mr. Everett will begin to blog on a regular basis. Expect movie, video game, and television reviews. Mr. Everett will also comment on books, news items, observations, and commentaries on his own writings.
