I'm not the first to say this, but I want to comment on it anyway. Friends on facebook are a bunch of bullshit. Seriously, I see people with 500+ friends, and I know that they aren't really friends with all these people. Hey, I know how it is. It feels good to be able to say that you have tons of friends. It's a self-esteem boost. That, however, is the lie.
I, myself, was caught up in that lie. I found myself adding new facebook friends everyday. You know how there's that box with "people you might know". I looked at that every day. I never had a list as big as some of those that you see, but mine was fairly long. Recently, I've been looking at it, and thinking about how much bullshit it is. I realized that except for a select few, none of these people were really my friends, so I deleted over half the people on my friends list.
Having friends on facebook had turned from a self-esteem booster to a depressive nightmare. It only made me feel bad for myself that none of my "friends" gave a shit about me. The friends list on facebook should not be called a "friends" list at all. It should be called the "people I met one time and decided I'd add them to my collection of "friends" to make me feel better about myself" list, or maybe just the "bullshit friends" list.
