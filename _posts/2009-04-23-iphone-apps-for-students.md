You may have seen the new iPhone series of commercials in which the announcer says, "you may need... There's an app for that." Well I have been seeing a new one recently targeted at students. It has sayings such as, "You need to find housing closer to campus. There's an app for that," etc. Several of these involve apps for finding ways to save money. One in particular is about finding the best price on a biology book. WHAT THE HECK! I think that if you are in college and you're concerned about saving money on a biology book, then why the hell would you own an iPhone. You should probably get a cheaper cell phone data plan before worrying about saving ten bucks on a textbook. "You realize that you're too dumb to be in college cause you spending too much money on your cell phone bill. There's an app for that."
