I listen to a <a href="http://podcastdownload.npr.org/anon.npr-podcasts/podcast/1017/104707830/npr_104707830.mp3">podcast</a> every few days which is a compilation of stories related to the economy that were broadcast on NPR. The link to this particular podcast is attached to this post. Well I guess that NPR held a challenge for listeners to write Haikus about the recession. One Haiku was particularly hilarious to me, it appears about 11:50 in the podcast. It goes as follows:
<blockquote>girl, you are so fine
I made you dinner myself
mmmm, ramen noodles</blockquote>
So true of the recession.
