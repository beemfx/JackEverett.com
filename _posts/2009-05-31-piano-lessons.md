As a young man of about fourteen or fifteen, I did as many do at some point in their life, I took piano lessons. Naturally I dropped out after my first year, but I do have a fond memory of them. After a several lessons my teacher had another book for me to practice from. The book had various simple recital pieces. One was entitled "Little Bird Lost". The song was a sad piece, but it didn't have any lyrics. I, however, made some lyrics up. The song had a main phrase that repeated twice, and then a variation on that theme with a few more notes. They lyrics I made up were, "Little bird lost... Little bird lost... Little bird lost, his head..." A very sad song indeed.
