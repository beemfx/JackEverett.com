Being that I'm no father, I'm not afraid to say this. Newborn babies are ugly. On my facebook account several of my friends with newborns have posted pictures of their babies, and I'm sorry to say, when a baby comes out of the womb it is pretty freaking ugly. I'm saying even after they clean it off. It seems to me that it takes a few days before babies start looking cute.
The reason I bring this up is because at my work employees tend to post pictures of their kids on a bulletin board. A friend of mine commented that some people's babies are just not very cute. Now I had already seen pictures of his newborn which he had posted on facebook and I was thinking to myself, speak for yourself, your baby looks pretty ugly in one of the pictures you have posted.
I'm not saying his baby is ugly, because in fact some of the pictures taken after he was alive for a few weeks look cute, but the picture of his baby as a newborn is way ugly. The same is true for another friend of mine's baby.
My point is, even though you may want to take pictures of your baby right after they are born, please only post those pictures which are taken at least a couple weeks after the birth.
