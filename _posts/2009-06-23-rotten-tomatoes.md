I have a friend that swears by <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, a website dedicated to compiling movie reviews and coming up with a final rating based on a collection of professional movie reviews. I'm sorry to say that I just can't go to the movies based on other people's reviews. I've tried. It doesn't work. I got to movies by what looks interesting, and in some cases I'm wrong and it's a terrible movie, and in other cases I really like the movies I go to see.

The reason I bring this up is because I had a free movie ticket, and a friend of mine informed me that "Drag Me To Hell" got 93% on Rotten Tomatoes so it must be a great movie. Well I went to see it, and I'm sorry to say it was one of the most boring movies I've seen this year. Maybe I just didn't understand the genre, but as far as I was concerned Rotten Tomatoes was wrong. On the other hand "Terminator: Salvation" got a 33% rating on the website, and I actually really liked it.

My point isn't that Rotten Tomatoes is inaccurate, but that in general we like the movies we like, and we don't like the movies we don't like, and it doesn't really matter what the critics say. The truth is even the worst movie ever made has fans.
