It's no secret that Windows Vista has received just about the worst criticism as anything else Microsoft has released, and though serious Windows Users have defended Vista, claiming that once it was patched, it wasn't so bad, there can be no defense of it now. Even with all the patches and service updates available for Windows Vista it is not even comparable to Windows 7. They are on a totally different scale.
Windows 7 is a much better experience than all previous versions of windows. It feels smoother, more solid, and more reliable than previous releases. It doesn't eat up hardware resources. It has a less confusing name. (Seriously, what does NT, XP, and Vista mean?) Honestly, to really appreciate Windows 7 you have to try it out, and though it won't be released to the general public until next month, it is definitely worth upgrading when that time comes.
It is true that Windows 7 is not perfect, and users can definitely expect service updates and patches, but hey, there's probably no such thing as the perfect operating system (though Linux and Mac users may disagree).
