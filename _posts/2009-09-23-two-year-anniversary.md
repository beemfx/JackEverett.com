The two year anniversary of Rough Concept was on September 16th. Due to a complete overhaul of the Rough Concept website this past summer, there was little in the way of celebrating. However, readers can expect to start seeing regular blog posts, and access to the most comprehensive library of Mr. Everett's written works. Including out of print and never before seen content.
