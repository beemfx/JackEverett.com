<i>A Merry Mirthworm Christmas</i> was released in 1984, it is perhaps the rarest of the TV specials that I watch during the Christmas season. It is the story of Bert Worm who recently moved into the town of Wormingham. Trying to make some new friends, he helps with the preparations for the annual Christmas celebration. Due to clumsiness, he wrecks some decorations and otherwise causes havoc in the town hall. He is asked to leave by the protagonist Wormaline Wiggler. Figuring that he'll never fit in, he decides to leave Wormingham. When the mayor finds out what happened he tells Wormaline that she needs to apologize to Bert. At that time some of the worms discover that Bert has left town, and so they search for him. There is eventually a happy ending, but I don't want to give everything away.

What I think is especially strange is that this is called <i>A Merry Mirthworm Christmas</i> as if people know what <i>Mirthworms</i> are. I've never heard of Mirthworms outside of this short. Last year I did an extensive search of the topic, and found that the company that produced this feature had produced two other shorts that featured Mirthworms, but other than that I couldn't find anything about them. As far as I know this was the first show to ever feature Mirthworms. Maybe there are Mirthworm children's books, but I certainly haven't seen any. Like many of the rarer Christmas shows, this has not been released on DVD.

It's a good show, to say the least. I enjoy watching it. The soundtrack is well done, with a few original songs that are quite fitting to the theme. It really gives you that warm feeling that you want to feel during Christmas. I'd recommend it, if you ever actually get the chance to see it. Well enough about that, check back in tomorrow.
