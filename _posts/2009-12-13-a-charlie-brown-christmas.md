<i>A Charlie Brown Christmas</i> released in 1965 could possibly be the most famous and popular Christmas show in existence. I don't think there is any reason for me to explain the plot at all, because you've probably seen it, multiple times. Interestingly enough this is one of the few Christmas shows that actually features the Bible story in it, as Linus quotes "Luke 2".

The only thing I really have to say about this is that the Christmas play that the characters are rehearsing could possibly be the dumbest play to have ever been performed. After all, the only thing that the characters do is dance like a bunch of idiots. Linus complains about having to memorize lines, but there aren't any lines in their play, they just dance. Also, the dialog implies that maybe the play was supposed to be a traditional pageant with the shepherds and a manger in a stable, but Lucy says she's going to be the "Christmas Queen", and how that would fit in is beyond me. Also, I have never heard of aluminum trees before, maybe they were a 60s thing.

Yes, the film is silly, but get this, a second Charlie Brown Christmas special was released in 1992 entitled <i>It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown</i>. The DVD I have included this as a bonus, and I watched it several years ago, just to see what it was about, and it was awful. I remembered that it had no plot whatsoever, but I wanted to see for sure, so I watched it again tonight. I was right, it has no plot, it's just a bunch of scenes of the characters doing various things related to Christmas. It could quite possibly be the worst Charlie Brown show ever made.

So that's really all I have to say today. I know I didn't comment on Charlie Browns ridiculous tree, and how it constantly changes size and shape, but really nothing in this show obeys the laws of physics, so I didn't think it was that big of a deal. Anyway, check back tomorrow.
