<i>Jingle All the Way</i> was released in 1996 starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. The story is about a man named Howard Langston who is trying to buy a Turbo Man action figure for his son on Christmas Eve day. I've received a lot of criticisms over the years for being a fan of this film, but I enjoy it a lot, and I'm not embarrassed to admit that. I find it very funny. I will admit, however, that the ending sequence feels a little out of place and absurd. I mean seriously, Schwarzenegger is flying around in a jet pack in a Christmas movie.

This is the only film of my tradition that I actually saw in the theater, and one of the few movies that I added to the tradition after seeing it. Interestingly enough, I'm a pretty big Arnold Schwarzenegger fan, and this was the first film of his that I saw in theaters.

It used to be that I waited until the day before Christmas Eve to watch this film, as it was my favorite Christmas movie, but this year I figured that there is a film that I like just a little bit better, so I will be watching that tomorrow, and on Christmas Eve I will be watching one of the best Christmas shows of all time.
