Acne is something that I've wanted to comment on for a some time, and I'm not promising that anyone that reads this is going to be cured, but I do have something important to say about it. Now, it should be known that I never had severe acne, but from around sixteen to nineteen I would have semi-frequent mild outbreaks, usually localized to very specific regions of my face. Naturally, I felt uncomfortable with it, not only did I think it was unattractive, but it felt gross and I couldn't get over the temptation to pop the pimples.

I tried the over the counter products. Specifically, the Oxy pads, and anyone that's tried those knows they don't do anything. Of course there are other products as well, and entire systems, like Neutrogena and Proactiv. I never tried any of these, but my brother who had more severe outbreaks did, and all proved useless.

Well having tried some of these products, I figured I'd talk to an expert. No, not Jessica Simpson of the Proactiv fame. Instead I went to see an actual bonified doctor with a medical degree. Well my doctor said, "why don't we try an antibacterial," and he gave me a prescription for tetracycline. So I started taking that, and within days the pimples were gone, and they stayed gone for as long as I was on the drug. Who would have thought it could be so simple and painless?

Now I'm not saying tetracycline is the cure for everyone, but I am saying that instead of wasting your (or your parent's) money on scams that may have absolutely no scientific backing, you should go see a doctor. It's that simple. Believe me, if your acne is so bad that your doctor can't write a prescription for it, then you are certainly going to be out of luck with anything sold over the counter. To be honest, I don't even think it is worth trying any of the advertised products, but I'm sure that doctors will give good results.

Of course, I don't have acne anymore. Getting older has taken care of that. And with most people, getting through puberty will do the same, but you don't have to wait that long, not if your doctor has anything to say about it.

The bottom line is that there are a lot of myths about acne, and a lot of self proclaimed "miracle" cures, but life doesn't have to be that hard. It can be as simple as a visit to the doctor's office.
