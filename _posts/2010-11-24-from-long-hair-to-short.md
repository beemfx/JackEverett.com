Being that I'm a writer, I'm not apt to post pictures of myself, but friends of mine know that I had long hair for the past two years, and that I recently cut it. I want to comment on that experience and my reasons for doing so. I know that for some people, such a drastic change in appearance can come quite difficult, but this wasn't a hard decision for me. In fact it was quite easy.

Many longhairs would object to me cutting my hair. Indeed, longhairs have an unwritten code that they've grown their hair long because they don't want to conform to the standards that society has set for them, and cutting their hair is a sign of submission. Indeed, that is why I grew my hair long. Like my former comrades, I was a longhair solely to be different from everybody else, and I liked that. But, unfortunately that was the only thing I liked about long hair.

The truth is that I hated my long hair, and, worse, it took a lot of work to maintain. Now, let me clarify, I'm not saying long hair is going to be uncomfortable for everyone, and I'm not even saying it's bad for men to have long hair, but I personally found that I did not like it on myself. That's why the decision to cut my hair came so easily.

Let me provide a little justification for my actions. I always wore my hair in a ponytail, and I literally mean always. The only time I let it down was when I went to bed. To be honest, I kind of liked having a ponytail, but it took a lot of work to get a decent looking ponytail. That might sound strange, but it's true. You'd think that for a ponytail, all that would be required is to pull your hair back and put a hair tie on. True, you <i>can</i> do that, but my hair is so fine that doing so, basically gave me this really ugly ponytail that was flaring out all over the place. I found that if I wanted a nice looking ponytail that fell straight down, I had to first flat iron my hair.

Women will know how much work it takes to flat iron your hair. It was at least a twenty minute process to go from my morning hair to a ponytail. Twenty minutes? Wow, that is a long time for a guy to be doing his hair, especially if it's only for a ponytail. Granted, I now understand why women spend so much time in the bathroom, and that's probably a good lesson to have learned, but it was a daily process that I could no longer tolerate.

Further, showering takes forever with long hair. Washing it takes a long time, too long for me. I hate showering to begin with, so making the process even longer was all the more worse. I found that I could wash my hair only every other day, and that saved some time, and was a little more manageable. But if I went three days without washing my hair I'd end up with a greasy mop on my head. And don't forget that hair has to dry after you wash it, and long hair takes a long time to dry.

I've had long hair in the past, but never so long as my recent growth, and I never want to have long hair again. My reasons for growing my hair out (which will remain unsaid) were stupid, and my reasons for keeping it long were even stupider. I suppose what finally made me to decide to cut it, was that when I looked at myself in the mirror with my hair down, I laughed at what I saw. In <i>my</i> opinion I looked stupid, and I knew the only remedy was to cut it. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying that men shouldn't have long hair, I'm just saying that I didn't like it on me.

I know what it's like to walk around and know that you're different from everybody else, and that's a good thing. In truth, I miss that. I kind of wish I still looked different. Now, when I walk around there is nothing particularly noticeable about me, and things will probably stay that way. Unfortunately, looking different from everybody else did not outweigh the simple fact that I didn't like having long hair.

I think it is the philosophy of longhairs that they do what they want to do, despite what other people may think, and that is still my philosophy. I didn't cut my hair to conform to any kind of standard, I cut it solely because I wanted to do what felt the best for me. I like having short hair, and I offer no apologies for cutting my hair. Some of my friends were disappointed to see me cut my hair, others commented on how much better I looked. The truth is, I didn't care what they had to say, because what I did, I did for me.
