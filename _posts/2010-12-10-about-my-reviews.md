My readers will notice right away that there is no consistent pattern to the games and products I choose to review. Not everything I review is new, in fact most of the items I review are several years old. I review every game I play no matter how old or how new it is. I review products that I think are deserving of a review, and I review novels after I've read them. The reason I'm writing today, though, is to comment on the rating system that I used to assign a rating to a product.
First of all I want to say that I don't think anything needs a rating. Rating systems are completely arbitrary, and are open to any kind of interpretation. Essentially they are meaningless. Let me explain by using game reviews as an example. Traditionally speaking a rating of 7/10, 70%, or C would imply that a game is average, meaning it is comparable to other games of the same type. It in no way should apply that a game is bad, however if a fan of that game saw that it had a 70% rating they would be astounded, they might say something like "It's my favorite game, why did you give it such a bad rating". Most readers would agree, 70% sounds bad, realistically it's not bad, it's average. That, however, is why rating systems are arbitrary. I believe that a the real key to a good review is not a "final verdict", but in the objectivity of the review itself.
The purpose of a review is not simply state whether something is good or bad, it is to explain why that thing is good, why it is bad, what specific parts of it may be unlikeable, and finally give the reader an idea of whether or not they would be interested in the item of review. Ratings or scores answer absolutely none of those questions.
With that said, I do have a rating system because it seems to be the popular thing to do, and I will explain that system. My rating system is the <b>2 to 9 scale</b>. That is, everything is rated from 2/10 to 9/10, whole numbers only, no decimal places. The obvious concern about this scale is that there is no 1/10 and 10/10. There is a reason why I don't include those in the scale, I believe that they are theoretical only. Sure you could say something is 10/10, but theoretically, there could be something a whole magnitude better than it, but then where can you go? 11/10 is ambiguous, it implies that any arbitrary number could be handed out, you could say something was 100/10, and suddenly 11/10 is seems shoddy. No, instead 10/10 is theoretical only, nothing can ever reach that value, the very best of the best is only 9/10.
The same applies for 1/10, instead of going into negative numbers or zeroes, 2/10 is the limit, 1/10 is the theoretically lousy item, that is worse than even the worst of the 2/10s.
Now as I've stated, rating systems are completely arbitrary, but to clear up what I mean when I give something a rating, I'll explain.
<ul>
<li>7/10, 8/10, 9/10: The item reviewed should appeal to everyone, but lower numbers imply that maybe a similar item with a higher number might be a better choice.</li>
<li>6/10: Good, but has obvious flaws.</li>
<li>5/10: Neutral. The item reviewed isn't necessarily bad, but it's not that great.</li>
<li>2/10, 3/10, 4/10: The item reviewed is bad, it shouldn't be used at all.</li>
</ul>
