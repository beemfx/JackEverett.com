'Halloween is coming soon, and that means we can expect to see people dressing up, wild parties, and late nights. Halloween isn\'t the only time people dress up though. Check out this police report:\r\n\r\n<small>September 19: [University] Police received a report of a person dressed in a gorilla suit looking in the windows of the Living Learning Center. Police located the two individuals. They were removed from campus.</small>\r\n\r\nThis boggles my mind. I don\'t know what could possible possess a person to do this. What\'s more is that over the next few weeks the person in the gorilla suit made more appearances. The first time I read about it, it was weird, after that it was just plain creepy.\r\n\r\nIt is also one of the funniest things I can think of. Seriously, how often do you hear about such bizarre behavior? The event may have been a harmless prank, the report on the incidents don\'t really give any details, but it seems that the guy is a peeping tom.\r\n\r\nMy point in writing about this is because I don\'t know if I should be laughing at this, or concerned about it. My gut tells me to laugh, but I\'m also glad that no one in a gorilla suit is knocking on my door. I can understand why at dress up parties masks are usually forbidden, it\'s very hard to trust someone whose face you can\'t see.
