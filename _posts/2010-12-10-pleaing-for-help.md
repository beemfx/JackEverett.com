Anyone who uses the internet has stumbled on Yahoo Answers at some point. Yahoo Answers is a forum where a person can ask a question, and then hopefully get a response. In deed, many questions that might come up have been asked and answered on this site. There is one classification of questions, however, that I find most saddening. Those are the "How can I find the will to live?" questions. These aren't very common on the sight, but there are many of them.
What saddens me the most about these anonymous pleas for help on the internet, is not that the person asking them is depressed, it is that they are depressed, and they had no one but cyberspace to go to, to ask for help. Worse, the probably don't even have online friends, or another forum where they make regular posts, and Yahoo Answers was the only place for them to go.
Most of the suicide threats I've read on Yahoo Answers seem to come from teenagers or younger. The responses are interesting, most responders simply tell them not to commit suicide, but there is always one preacher. Someone who writes about how much God loves them. The truth is I don't think any kind of response can help someone like that. These people need friends, not sympathy, and they certainly don't need to be preached to.
How do I know? I am one.
