I remember a riddle quite well from my childhood. The question was: You find yourself in a room, with no door, and only a mirror and a table, how do you get out?
The answer is: You look in the mirror. You see what you saw. You take the saw. You cut the table in half. Two halves make a whole. You climb through the hole.
The idea behind this answer was that you had to "think outside the box" to figure it out. I may be wrong, but I don't think giving the answer to this riddle has anything to do with thinking outside a box, it has to do with thinking totally irrationally and illogically. This is a complete play on words. Whole and hole aren't even spelled the same.
This riddle does have certain psychological applications however, related to functional fixedness. Functional fixedness is the cognitive bias that limits a person to using an object only in the way it is traditionally used.
Now imagine a slightly different question: You are in a room, two ropes hang from the ceiling, for some unexplained reason you need to tie them together, so you grab one end of the rope, and walk towards the other rope, but you can't quite reach it. You search the room for anything that might help, but all you find is a box of nails and a hammer. How do you tie the ropes together.
The logical answer is to tie the hammer to one of the ropes, then swing that rope through the air. The weight of the hammer will give the rope enough momentum to keep moving, while you walk to the other rope, grab it, then grab the swinging rope.
