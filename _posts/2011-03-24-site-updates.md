It's that time of year again when some serious website maintenance needs to be completed. The blog portion of the site is run using <a href="http://b2evolution.net/">b2evolution</a>, which has recently gone into version 4.0.5, and we're excited to update the blog to the new version of the blog software. However, this is a major update, and some of the customized code for the Rough Concept website may need to be modified, so the website might be behaving strangely for the next few days.
