I recently viewed another blogger's website, and noticed that they had put together a list of all the video games that they had played. Lists are something I considered for a while, and I have wanted to put together a list of all the books I've read. But after seeing this other blogger's list, I want to put together more lists than simply "books I've read". So I have gotten my website developer to do some serious updates that will allow me to post lists, and various other content within the site. My first list, which will be of video games I have played will be up shortly, I'll also be getting around to the book's I've read list. And potentially a movies I've seen list.
