The new software for Rough Concept was launched. Unfortunately much of the old software is incompatible, so large portions of the site will be down for a while. Mr. Everett's short stories are gone, and all blog posts were reset to basic text, so they are missing formatting and pictures. It will be an ongoing process to correct the funny looking parts of the site.
