"Smee died!" I blurted out to my sister as we were driving together. She looked at me in confusion. "From Hook?" It didn't take her long to figure out who Smee was since we both enjoy quoting the 1995 film ''Hook''. Some of our favorite quotes include "Death is the only adventure!", "I hate, I hate, I hate Peter Pan!", and simply saying the word "Grace!" to pray over dinner. "Yeah," I said, "Bob Hoskins died this year." She replied with, "Oh, I didn't realize Bob Hoskins played Smee."

I knew I had left her wondering why I blurted out so strange a fact, so I decided to explain. We'd been driving down the freeway and I saw a vehicle license plate that started with FVK, and I thought to myself, that's similar to FMV. FMV stands for Full Motion Video, which was a type of video game made in the 1990s where the video game cut together filmed footage of actors. The video being cut together differently depending on the player's input.

This got me thinking about the game ''A Fork in the Tale'', an FMV game of which I'd played the demo, but not the full thing. Then I was wondering what other FMV games were around that I'd never played. And I remembered that there was this game called ''Discworld 2: Mortality Bytes'' which for some reason, having never played, I incorrectly thought was partly FMV partly cartoon (the game I was actually thinking of was ''Toonstruck''). You know, like the film ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit?''.

Then I was thinking that Bob Hoskins was in ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit?'', a film that I saw for the first time this year, and I remembered that a few days prior I had read an article about celebrities that had died this year, and Bob Hoskins was one of them, and I knew that my sister and I had both seen ''Hook''. Hence I declared, "Smee Died!"
