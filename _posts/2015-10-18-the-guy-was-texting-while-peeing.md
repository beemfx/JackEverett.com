So this guy taking a pee next to me in a public bathroom the other day was texting while peeing. To go into a lot of detail I also want it to be known that he also switched the phone from his right to left hand during the pee. I guess my point is that society has reached a new low. All I can do is shake my head and say "These darn kid's these days". By the way this guy was in his 40s or 50s.
