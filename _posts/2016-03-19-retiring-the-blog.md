Mr. Everett has decided to go on hiatus from writing the blog. While a few more posts might come out in the next few weeks, very little will be written after that. Mr. Everett's interests are in  other areas at this time, primarily video game development and working on his novel. He stated, "There simply isn't enough time or creative energy for me to put into anecdotal writing at this time." Whether he will return to blogging at some point in the future is yet to be determined.
