In going over the Elder Scrolls series, I had a lot of fun in Oblivion. My fondest memory of the game was on my second or third play through. I felt I had sufficiently completed the game. I felt my character was tired from years of battle, so I took my character to the bridge just outside the Imperial City, removed all my armor and weapons, put on some comfortable clothes, and threw all my armor and weapons off the bridge and into the sea with the intent of never doing battle again. That is what it is to roleplay a game. That was a good memory. My character kept only a sword, just in case.
