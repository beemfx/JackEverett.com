<p> I dreamed I was back on the sort aisle. And they let me come in  early. But I’d completely forgotten where everything went. So eventually  I asked around to get the elusive load chart. And by doing that someone  said I had to re-certify. And I am like dang  I will never be able to do that. And for some reason my finger nails  were falling apart and I kept biting them off. So finally I find this  guy that can set me up with a sort chart and create me login credentials  for the computer to take the test. But my name  isn’t in the system at all so I can’t actually take the test. </p>

<p>So when I had come in early to sort. Someone  had written a bunch of “orange” on some packages all angry like because I  guess they were mis-sorted.</p>

<p>And also this tour came by and I was like  trying to impress them by doing my thing but I was so bad at it. That’s  the point when I realized I needed a sort chart.</p>
