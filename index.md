Welcome to my website. The only part I currenlty maintain is my [Completed Games List]({{ '/pages/lists/video-games-i-ve-played' | relative_url }}) so check that out to see all the awesome games I've played.

Other than that this is a preservation of the blog I kept as well as some of my writings that have been available online. There's also some links from when I tried to become a YouTuber.

I've been dabling with where to preserve this content and ultimately decided on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) since that seemed the most flexible in terms of presenting content in the style I wanted.
