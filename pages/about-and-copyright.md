## About
This website is an archive of the creative works of Jack Everett for public viewing.

Jack Everett originally obtained the domain roughconcept.com in 2007 as a place to post his short stories. A short time later he took a stab at blogging. Being that the blog never really had a following he eventually dropped the roughconcept.com brand in favor of jackeverett.com to consolodate his endeavors.

Though the "Rough Concept" brand has been abandoned, Mr. Everett had the following to say concerning the original name of the website RoughConcept.com:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The name <em>Rough Concept</em> was chosen because I feel that none of my work is finished. That is to say, I consider all my work to be rough drafts (or concept drafts), and even the best of my work is subject to change, should I see the need, or have the desire, to modify it. Intelligent comments made about my work, do indeed, have the potential to influence future edits of any of my work.</p></blockquote>
