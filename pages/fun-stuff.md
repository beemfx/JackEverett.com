<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Macaulay Culkin Book Cover</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a weird nostalgic memory I have. When I was in elementary school they were handing out book covers/protectors (I'm not sure what they are called, but thick paper that you could wrap around textbooks to protect the surface). The book cover they gave use was two sided, on one side was Macaulay Culkin, on the other side was MC Hammer. It was also themed with this "Who's Cool" and "Who's Hot" text.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were also little biographies for the characters with different "vital" stats. I remember for MC Hammer it said: "Dropped MC: Because he was tired of explaining what it stood for" and that he did "200 pushups" before going on stage. I don't remember any of the Macaulay Culkin vital stats, and in fact I didn't even know who he was because I had not yet seen Home Alone. In any case I put it on this copy of "One Fat Summer" by Robert Lipsyte that I had which was too small a book for it since it was meant for textbooks, so most of Macaulay's face was cut off.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I don't have it anymore, but I think about it from time to time and I can't find any evidence that it existed. I still have the copy of "One Fat Summer" but not that cover.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">First Computer </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> My family’s first computer was a Packard Bell Legend 2430. It had a  75Mhz Intel Pentium processor, 8MB RAM, 1MB video memory (integrated  into motherboard), 4X CD-Rom Drive, 3.5 Floppy, 600MB Hard Drive (yes 600MB). It ran on Packard Bell’s own PB640 Mainboard.<br><br> I still sort of have that computer, though the only actual part from it  is the PB640 Mainboard. It now has the following specs: 200Mhz Intel  Pentium processor, 128MB RAM, ATI Xpert 128 video card (16MB video  memory, I think), 8GB hard drive, 8X CD-Rom, 3.5 Floppy, and PB640  Mainboard. I still boot up the computer from time to time. Mostly for  nostalgia, but also to run the occasional software that only worked on  Windows 98 or earlier.<br><br> It was the computer I wrote the original QBasic version of <a href="https://github.com/beemfx/Castle/tree/master/Old%20Versions/1%20QBASIC%20Original">Castle</a> on.<br></p>

Ticks &amp; Tricks magazine that featured Supreme Warrior and the cheat 
code for Rings of Power. I wish I could see a copy of that magazine 
again. Found it: Tips and Tricks July 1995.</li>

<p> One thing I don’t talk about much is the time I lived in Iowa. For those  of us not from Iowa, that were there, we liked to make fun of it. Here  are some acronyms made up. The first one is very commonly known, the  others were made up by friends of mine.<br></p>
