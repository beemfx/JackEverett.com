This is a list that, to the best of my recollection, documents every video game that I’ve played. It is fairly complete, but I know that I’m still missing quite a few games that I played before 1998. The list is grouped by years to show some of the context in which I played these games.

I will try to organize this list in the reverse order that I completed the games, with the most recent first. However, because I didn’t exactly keep track of this list up until August 11, 2011 will not accurately reflect when I completed the games. If I never completed a game, or if the game isn’t completable (i.e. MMOs or simulation games) I will list it in the order of when I first played it.

This list was inspired by [another guy’s list](http://kentie.net/indices/2.htm).
