<h5>SCENE 1</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>(In the damp and dank prison cell, Curley and Candy enter by candlelight. George greets them, though somewhat hesitantly.)</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GEORGE<br>How is it that you are still alive, Candy?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CANDY<br>Chance I guess, people are living longer these days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CURLEY<br>Why do you care so much for the condition of this old man?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GEORGE<br>If you don’t care, then why did you come here?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CURLEY<br>Therein lays the evident question, I did not choose to come here. The author of this dialog assigned me as one of the voices of this piece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CANDY<br>Therein lays the evident idiotism, as I recall we did not use such language at the time of our previous relationship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GEORGE<br>Therein lays the matter of discussion I would like to bring up, being that it is that issue which has brought me into these dampened depths to begin with.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CANDY<br>You refer to the untimely death of Lennie.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GEORGE<br>I do. For many years now, as I’ve lain upon the reformatory bunk, my mind has pondered deeply the association I had with his demise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CANDY<br>And what have been your thoughts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GEORGE<br>Only of my own upcoming end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CANDY<br>You refer to the bowels of Hell.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GEORGE<br>I do, for though these prison walls have treated me unkindly I expect no mercy from whatever may lay in the hereafter. I ask of you Curley, would the demise that besought Lennie have been that of which he was ended.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CURLEY<br>It would have been, George.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GEORGE<br>Then I am unthankful, for I have done no good.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CURLEY<br>Is that to say that I would have done evil?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GEORGE<br>It is, but it is to say more than that as well. It is to say, in fact, that we are brothers, you and I, for our thoughts are the same, we are murderers, both of us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CURLEY<br>Perhaps in heart, but it was you who truly brought death.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GEORGE<br>But did you not taste the wrath when you found that your revenge had been taken.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CURLEY<br>You refer to my deficient wife.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GEORGE<br>I do. For we both know of the joy felt when we were relieved of him. You relieved of your revenge, and I relieved of my burden. Unfortunate, however, that my burden has only become greater since that time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CURLEY<br>You refer to your captivity?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GEORGE<br>Nay, I do not. I refer to the load that encumbers my soul. For there is no forgiveness for an executioner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CURLEY<br>But isn’t it also true that Lennie was a murderer, and should not a murderer be put to death? You were merely carrying out the law.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GEORGE<br>You are wrong. Firstly I was not carrying out the law as I had no legal ordinance on the matter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CURLEY<br>And secondly?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GEORGE<br>Lennie was never guilty. He may have killed, yes, but unawares of his actions for he was as a child.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CURLEY<br>But he was a child that would never grow into adulthood, and it has been made clear the dangers of such a child.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GEORGE<br>True, he was as a child with abilities beyond his control. But throughout history there have been men whom have abilities beyond their control. Was not Napoleon guilty?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CURLEY<br>He was.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GEORGE<br>He had power beyond his control, great armies, and navies. If such a man had not great armies or navies would he have been a wicked man?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CURLEY<br>Perhaps not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GEORGE<br>But Napoleon was a wicked man, nonetheless.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CURLEY<br>My viewpoint on the matter has not changed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GEORGE<br>Then it is clear that a man is responsible for his actions based on his control.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CURLEY<br>It is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GEORGE<br>Then is a child accountable for his actions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CURLEY<br>I think that he is, but my understanding is that you believe differently.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GEORGE<br>I do.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CURLEY<br>Indulge me on the matter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GEORGE<br>Such a man as Napoleon has claimed his power, and though he has little control over his power, it had been claimed by him nonetheless and therefore he is responsible. Such a child as Lennie has not claimed his strength, nevertheless it was forced upon him as he had no choice on the matter of his body entering into adulthood whereas his mind did not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CURLEY<br>Then your claim is that man is responsible for power he gains when he claims it for himself, whereas a man who does not claim power for himself is not responsible for it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GEORGE<br>Aye, that is my claim.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CURLEY<br>I am tempted to concur, but I require pondering on the matter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GEORGE<br>Ponder it then. And if you would like, report your thoughts to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CANDY<br>Shall we depart.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>GEORGE<br>Yes, depart now, and leave me to contemplate upon my thoughts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
