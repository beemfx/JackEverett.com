<p class="has-very-dark-gray-color has-very-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background has-small-font-size">Written in 1990. Iâ€™m pleased to present the very first story that I wrote (that still exists). <em>Mario Strikes Back</em>  was written even before I decided to become a writer. Basically I was  given a notebook at school, and so I figured I might was well write a  story. Even at a young age it shows my interest in video games.</p>

<p>Mario was having a hard time in school because the Hammer Brothers kept coming and did bad things to Mario. So he jumped on them and killed them. Mario took fake tests for when he fights King Koopa, so he can save the Mushroom Princess, and then Mario World would be safe. It took a while but he beat King Koopa, and Mario World was safe once again.</p>
