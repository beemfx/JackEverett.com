<p>The rotors of the UH-1 Huey were loud but rhythmic above, and the smell of oil in the air was euphoric. The tree line of the jungle below ended, and Sergeant James Rogers could see a military encampment in the clearing. He’d spent the last three years of his life as a prisoner of war, and it was a relief to see an American outpost. As the helicopter approached, the details of the camp became visible, and its age showed. A single dirt road ran through the camp from north to south, with several jeeps and transport trucks parked along it. The camp consisted mostly of military tents, a few dozen of them, set up on hardwood floors. Below, a man was waiting for the helicopter to land. When it touched down, the man walked towards it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Right this way,” the man shouted over the sound of the
rotors. The man wore the insignia of a captain, and his nametag read
‘Williams’. Rogers climbed out the helicopter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Williams led Rogers into one of the tents. The air was stale
inside. A generator hummed outside. A single light bulb hung from the center of
the tent, but more light came through an open flap on the side. Two officers were
sitting at a table, one was reading an issue of <em>TIME</em> magazine, and the other was playing with a deck of cards. They
both stood up and saluted Williams as he entered. Rogers stood still, staring
at the men.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“At ease,” Williams said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rogers took note of the officers’ insignias. One was a first
lieutenant, probably with one to two years of service, maybe even with combat
experience. The other was a second lieutenant, perhaps fresh out of Officer’s Candidate
School. Rogers felt slightly out of place, with all these uniforms around him. He
was wearing the clothes he’d been given the day before his release; a plain
button up shirt and loose fitting draw-string trousers, very civilian compared
to these men. It didn’t help his comfort level that everyone in the room
outranked him either.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Williams introduced the two officers. “This is Lieutenant
Hammond.” The first lieutenant stepped up to Rogers and offered him a firm
handshake and a friendly smile. “And Lieutenant Winfield.” The second lieutenant
also shook his hand. This man was less enthusiastic, his handshake was weak,
and he hardly glanced at Roger’s eyes. His skin was not calloused either,
confirming that this guy was fresh out of the States. A cat mewed. Rogers
looked for it, and saw it sitting on a file cabinet. It was strange to see a domesticated
pet in the jungle. He figured one of the locals must have brought it to the camp
for trade.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“And this,” Winfield said, as he walked over to the cat and took
it from the cabinet, “is LBJ, Jr.” He stroked the cat’s head and back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rogers raised his brow as he watched Winfield caress the
cat. Winfield had certainly been in Asia only a few months, and had likely gotten
a commission as an officer simply to be able to <em>say</em> he had served his country. It wasn’t a surprise that this guy was
holding a cat in the middle of what had been a warzone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Winfield continued, “After a late night at the Officer’s
Club we thought we’d give tribute to the man that started this chaos.” He let
out a brief chuckle. Hammond half smiled as he watched Winfield stroke the cat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Williams cleared his throat and Winfield let the cat leap
from his arms onto the floor. The cat quickly returned to the top of the
cabinet. “Winfield and Hammond will debrief you shortly, and then we’ll see if
we can’t get you a steak dinner.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Steak sounded a lot better than the usual rice and
occasional vegetables of the prison, but Rogers had eaten a C-Ration on the ride
in, which had sated his appetite. “Okay,” he said, speaking for the first time.
He had spoken so quietly that he wasn’t sure if the men had heard him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;Williams walked to
the table where Winfield and Hammond had been sitting, then he picked up some
papers, and as he looked through them he said, “You’ll be at Clark Air Base tomorrow,
and then off to the States. You’ll have to spend the night here, but you’re
lucky. This place may look primitive, but the USO has provided us with movies,
hot showers, and…”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Showers?” Rogers cut him off. That was what he really
wanted. For the past three years bathing had consisted of a bucket of water and
rags. “Could I…” His throat was dry, his voice was weak. “Could I get one now?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Williams looked away from the papers in his hands. “Of
course.” He turned to the second lieutenant. “Winfield, why don’t you get Sergeant
Rogers some soap and show him to the showers. We can worry about the paperwork
later.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Winfield raised his eyebrows at Rogers, looked at the cards
on the table, and then to Williams. “Yes, sir,” he replied. Winfield led
Roger’s out of the tent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Outside, the brown dirt road might have looked plain and
drab, but with the tents and vehicles surrounding it, it was a big improvement
over the gray prison cell where Roger’s had spent most of his time. Just the
fact that the sky was visible above, made him feel comfortable there. The camp
was far enough away from the tree line that the smell of plant life was
present, but not too overpowering. It was quiet too, peaceful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They went to another tent that was stacked full of tables,
drawers, cabinets, and other unused equipment. Winfield managed to dig out a
towel and a bar of soap, but that didn’t seem like enough to Rogers. It hardly
seemed better than what he had had as a prisoner. “Damn it, man,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Winfield stood up straight and looked back at him with wide
eyes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;“I need a sponge. I
want to scrub the NVA stench out of my bones.” It was strange to bark like that
at a superior. Certainly he would have shown more respect to Captain Williams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Winfield jerked hesitantly and narrowed his eyes. After a
few seconds he raised his brows. “I guess there’s probably one in the mess,” he
said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“So what are you waiting for?” Rogers’ voice was much
stronger now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Winfield handed Rogers the soap and towel, and disappeared
out the flaps. Rogers left more slowly, eventually stepping out into the
sunlight. A few soldiers were wrestling on the other side of the road. When
they saw that he was watching them they stopped for a moment, acknowledging him,
then they continued their games. The cat had also made its way outside. It was
watching the wrestlers as well, and licking its paws.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Winfield returned with a sponge. Rogers took it, and
examined it to insure that it wasn’t covered in grease. It looked new, unused.
He nodded slightly to himself, and was tempted to smile. “Now, point me in the
direction of the showers,” he said sternly. “I don’t need anyone holding my
hand.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Just head north. Up the road.” Winfield pointed. “You’ll
see it on the east side.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Thanks,” Rogers replied without looking back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He rolled the sponge and soap into the towel as he walked. A
jeep drove by, and stopped in front of another tent. Some of the men in it were
drinking and singing something he had never heard before. He thought maybe he
could join them later, after he was done showering, and try to catch up on the
world around him. Find out if he still knew how to have fun. The men in the
jeep got out and went into the tent that they had parked in front of.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The showers weren’t hard to find. The building was a wooden
structure, with a tin roof and a large water tank on top. Just inside the
entrance was a bench. He unrolled the towel onto it and undressed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A dirty mirror behind some wash basins let him see himself. His
first reaction was to look away, but he looked at his reflection again. He had
the rough look of dirt smeared with sweat on his face, most of it acquired
during the day’s travel. There were some grease stains on his hands and face as
well. His hair had been unevenly trimmed. What really surprised him, though,
was how much weight he had lost. He hadn’t thought about that while in prison,
but seeing the other soldiers in the camp made it more apparent. He laughed
quietly. None of that mattered. He didn’t think he looked that bad, and a long
shower would help him feel that much better.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were six shower heads in the building, but no one else
was present. He’d have plenty of water form himself, and so he spent the next fifteen
minutes scrubbing down. It felt good as the warm water rinsed away the humid
sweat on his body. He enjoyed the rough feel of the sponge on his skin, and the
smell of the soap was clean and refreshing. He went over every inch of his body
twice, even blowing the snot out of his nose. After putting the soap and sponge
down he ran his fingers through his hair, gentle at first, then rougher to make
sure there weren’t any flakes in it. When he finished cleaning, he let the
water run over his body for a few minutes, stretching out his arms, and letting
the tension in his muscles subside.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When he was finished he shut off the shower head and walked
over to the bench where he had set the towel. He picked it up and started
drying himself. Shoulders first, then chest and neck, then face, and that’s
when he smelled it. The sharp, acrid, foul stench of piss invaded his nostrils.
The towel was covered in it. He threw it down immediately, and looked back and
forth. Winfield’s cat sat in the corner nearby. “Son of a bitch,” he shouted.
The cat looked at him, but didn’t run away. He clenched his fist ready to
express more anger, but then he relaxed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Without shame, he left building, and walked, naked, toward
the supply tent. The soldiers who had been wrestling cheered him on. When he
arrived at the supply tent, he found a fresh towel, and made sure it didn’t
smell of cat piss, then wrapped it around his waist, and headed back for
another shower. This time he would hang the towel high.</p>
