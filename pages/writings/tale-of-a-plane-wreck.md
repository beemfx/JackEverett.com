<h4>The Survival and History&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On July 14, 1939 United Airlines Boeing 747 number UAXN0001
crash landed on and uncharted island.&nbsp;
Most of the wreck was never recovered, and the cause of the crash was
never determined.&nbsp; Four passengers
survived the wreck.&nbsp; They were left with
few supplies, and had to rely only on their wits to survive.&nbsp; The survivors were Tyrel, Bane, Nathan, and
the young girl Jenni. The following is an account of the measures they took to
survive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the need for food was realized, Bane, the natural
leader, took initiative to manufacture weapons.&nbsp;
Within a few hours of the crash he brought forth a slain wild boar.&nbsp; The group, unwilling to feast on raw mammal
fibers, looked to Jenni who was talented in cooking.&nbsp; On the first night of their stay, and most
nights thereafter the group enjoyed sizeable feasts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Upon the first signs of thirst, as complained by Tyrel, the group attempted to drink from the ocean.  This water, contaminated with large deposits of salt, was found to be quite distasteful.  The group looked to Bane and his animal instincts to find water worthy of a human’s stomach.  After hours of Bane’s searching and Tyrel’s whining a hot stream was found.  Tyrel eager for drink dove into the stream and began to lap up the water.  Nathan looked to Tyrel, and Tyrel responded by nodding.  With this silent conversation Nathan declared, “The water is good”.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the discovery of the stream the group thought it best
to construct a base near the water.&nbsp;
Nathan, who served in the military, suggested that they dig a bunker system,
consisting of underground tunnels that would connect to all parts of the
island.&nbsp; The remainder of the group
agreed, and without hesitation Bane began digging.&nbsp; It wasn’t until seven years after their
arrival on the island that the bunker system was completed.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The bunker, after completion was a marvel of human
construction.&nbsp; It consisted of four fair
sized rooms to serve as sleeping and rest quarters for each of the
survivors.&nbsp; There was a much larger room
built for group meetings and dining.&nbsp; The
tunnel system connected to all parts of the island for safe underground
transportation.&nbsp; Several booby traps were
laid out for any hostile creatures unlucky enough to wander into the
tunnels.&nbsp; An enormous aqua-duct system
was also constructed to carry water to all parts of the island.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While it was true that the group looked to Bane as the
fearless leader who provided protection, Nathan was truly in charge.&nbsp; He used Tyrel who was capable of time telling
to assign duties on a systematic time schedule.&nbsp;
Bane would dig the bunker from 5 AM to 4 PM then hunt for food.&nbsp; Jenni would mend together animal furs to form
fabrics from 5 Am to 1 PM, she also had two breaks in that time, one to cook
breakfast the other for lunch. Following these duties she was permitted to rest.&nbsp; Tyrel was known only to be lazy and
complained much about work. He wandered around the island at will and
eventually wrote what he saw on a map.&nbsp;
Nathan, in actuality, did very little. His only known tasks were to tell
others what to do.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After eight years of entrapment many of the group members
became lonely and longed for companionship, these feeling struck Tyrel and Bane
most strongly.&nbsp; These two looked to
Jenni.&nbsp; For Jenni had changed much from
the violent girl of eleven she once had been.&nbsp;
She was eighteen, full of life, and had developed a very pleasing
figure.&nbsp; Tyrel began a courtship ritual.
Jenni was a bit disgusted with his sloppiness at first, but humored by his
sense of life, so she decided to allow the custom.&nbsp; Bane, however, still wanted companionship and
obeying his natural instincts decided to fight for Jenni.&nbsp; Tyrel unwilling break up with Jenni, decided
to defend his rite. Bane and Tyrel eventually engaged in battle. Tyrel’s, being
overweight, was slow and was no match for Bane’s large stature.&nbsp; It was never recorded exactly how the battle
proceeded but historians agree Tyrel was slaughtered by decapitation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jenni disgusted by Bane’s behavior never looked
at him again, and Bane’s attempted courtship was a failure.</p>

<p>Following the described battle, now known as the ‘Lover’s
brawl’, the party members discontinued dialogue.</p>

<h4>The Aftermath</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Upset at his inability to win Jenni, Bane wandered
throughout the island.&nbsp; His primary
territory was within the bunker system’s tunnels.&nbsp; He would surface from the tunnel only to hunt
for food.&nbsp; His hunting was consistent
with a wild lion.&nbsp; He would chase after
animals and strike them down with his bare hands and then proceed to chew into
their raw flesh.&nbsp; He was known to the
survivors as the “Beast” and was much feared.&nbsp;
Fearful of Bane’s animal instincts, Nathan barricaded the bunker’s
tunnels from the living quarters.&nbsp; At
night the animal howling of the “Beast” could be heard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jenni, who would have broken up with Tyrel and courted Bane
if he had asked, began unusual behavior.&nbsp;
Nathan recognized this as insanity.&nbsp;
He thought it best to prevent Jenni from hurting herself and tied her up
in her quarters.&nbsp; Often at night she
would reply to Bane’s animal howling with high pitched whines of her own.&nbsp; Nathan knew that one day she would break
free, kill him, and join Bane where together they would form their own animal
kingdom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nathan, shrouded in fear, and unable to hunt as Bane, was
barely able to survive. He was only capable of picking berries and never tasted
of soft animal flesh again. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On December 1, 1948 a military platoon set out to explore
the island.&nbsp; They found Nathan first,
distraught and barely clinging to sanity.&nbsp;
Nathan led them to the bonded Jenni, her violent spasms forced to soldiers
to cage her.&nbsp; Nathan then told the
soldiers of the “Beast”. Skeptical, ten soldiers went in to hunt this so called
“Beast”.&nbsp; Hours later, three men returned
with Bane tied up in nets and ropes.&nbsp;
None of these three soldiers would ever speak of the horrors that
happened to their fallen comrades.</p>

<p>And thus is the record of Bane, Nathan, Jenni, and Tyrel as
written by Alberich the scribe as compiled by historian’s written works and
actual verbal accounts of Bane, Nathan, and Jenny.</p>

<h4>Alternate Ending</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the three remaining party members were rescued, Bane
and Jenni made a complete mental recovery from their beast-like states.&nbsp; Bane is now studying law at Princeton University.&nbsp; Jenni is married to Bane, they have three
beautiful children.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nathan, who held on to his sanity until the end, lost it on
the helicopter ride from the island.&nbsp; He
is now being held at Harpington’s Emotional Help and Research Institution.&nbsp; He just finished his novel <em>My Journey to Hell and Back</em>, a gibberish
account of his experiences on the island.</p>
