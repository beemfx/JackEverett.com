<p class="has-text-color has-background has-small-font-size has-very-dark-gray-color has-very-light-gray-background-color">Written 2003. Originally this short short was a bit more vulgar but I toned it down in my more mature years.</p>

<p>Jack listened to the conversation behind the door.  A man and woman, he recognized the male voice from the recording, it was the mark.  Jack had been a contract killer for quite some time; he had been used to the killing from the start.  He quietly opened the door and stepped into the room.  </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The
couple had their backs to him, and they hadn’t noticed him enter the room.&nbsp; He listened to their conversation briefly,
fascinated.&nbsp; The man finally noticed Jack
standing near the door.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bang!  Jack shot the woman in the back; the bullet went all the way through her body and impacted in the wall.  Blood poured out of her chest, she collapsed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man grabbed a nearby shotgun.  He fired a round.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jack dodged the parade of pellets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man quickly began to reload the shotgun.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bang! Jack fired his gun.  Bang! Bang! Bang! Three more shots in quick succession landed in the man’s chest, he fell to the ground.  Blood spilled onto the floor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The woman was still breathing.  She hadn't died from the wound.  Jack stepped up to her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She begged for her life.  There was little that Jack could do.  She'd bleed to death in very little time.  She wasn’t a mark.  He called an ambulance and walked away.  She'd die, and he didn't care.</p>
