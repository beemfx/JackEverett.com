<p class="has-text-color has-background has-small-font-size has-very-dark-gray-color has-very-light-gray-background-color">Written ca. 2003 this is based off of a real experience of finding the things mentioned in the story and speculating as to why they were there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I still remember the most disturbing thing I have ever seen.  I wasn’t much older than seven years old, maybe even younger.  A couple of friends and I had decided we wanted to go to the park, because next to the park were giant sand dunes we could play on.  One of my friends had spoken on how we could run up and down them, as energized kids do, and that our clothes would turn white.  We had convinced a babysitter to take us to the park, not mentioning that we had planned on adventuring to the sand dunes nearby.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After arriving at the park we
explained to the babysitter our plan to play on the dunes.&nbsp; The babysitter didn’t object and we headed
towards them.&nbsp; The dunes were just to the
southeast of the park.&nbsp; Only a fence
divided them from the recreational area.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we walked towards the dunes,
which I could then see in the distant, my friends and I found something.&nbsp; I still remember to this day what I saw.&nbsp; As we played our way towards the dunes, we
stumbled into a small hollow under a pine tree’s branches.&nbsp; The pine branches covered the cavity so
completely that no one outside could see in, unless they were close enough to
the small break in the branches where the entrance was.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What we found inside the hollow is
something that bothers me to this day.&nbsp;
There were three items, a beach ball of some sort, a small pair of
pants, and a page from a pornographic magazine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I remember the beach ball with the
least detail from the other two items.&nbsp;
It was not very big, a six inch to one-foot diameter at most.&nbsp; I can’t recall what pattern was manufactured
on the ball; it was either multicolored sections or a soccer ball pattern.&nbsp; I remember that it was partially deflated of
air.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I remember the other two items
very well.&nbsp; The pair of pants was
extremely small; it wasn’t hard to make a conclusion that they came from a
toddler.&nbsp; I was only around four feet tall
at the time, and compared to my own pants at the time the ones I found were
small.&nbsp; They were somewhere between one
and two feet long, probably closer to one; and made of blue denim.&nbsp; I never investigated far enough to see what
brand they were.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I remember both sides of the page
from the pornographic magazine, though at the time I was not sure, exactly,
what I was looking at.&nbsp; Thinking back on
it, I know exactly what I saw.&nbsp; On one
side of the page there was text and a smaller picture.&nbsp; The opposite side was much more interesting
to me.&nbsp; It was a full print color page of
a woman lying on her back with her legs spread apart and up in air forming a
‘V’.&nbsp; The picture was centered on the
vaginal area between the model’s legs.&nbsp; I
believe her face was visible between her legs, but the rest of the picture was
strictly genital, no breasts visible.&nbsp;
Only the thigh parts of her legs were visible and they were clad in
fishnet stockings.&nbsp; She may have been wearing
garters, but her privates were visible.&nbsp;
Of course, at the time I had no idea what I was looking at, but I
remember it clearly now.&nbsp; The page was
somewhat crumpled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>One of my friends must have known
what the pornographic picture was of, because he said we should leave.&nbsp; I said that I wanted to investigate further
to find out what the meaning of all this was.&nbsp;
He was a convincing friend, so I never had the chance.&nbsp; I had wanted to take the magazine page with
me so I could study it and find out what I was looking at, not for sexual
reasons, but simply because I had never seen a females sex organ.&nbsp; My friends said I shouldn’t and tore up the
page.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We left that small hollow under
the tree, and headed for the sand dunes.&nbsp;
We never got the chance to play on them, because there was a keep out
sign on the fence.&nbsp; As hard as we tried
we couldn’t convince the babysitter to let us play there, so we ended up going
home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have contemplated many times
what the meaning of those three items was, and to this day I can come up with
only one explanation.&nbsp; We had stumbled
upon a child-raping bastard’s vile covert, where terrible deeds were conducted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ball must have been the
lure.&nbsp; Judging from the size of the
pants, it isn’t a wild assumption that a ball would fascinate anyone at that
age, and they were too young to understand when their parents instructed them
not to talk to strangers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pants belonged to the victim;
they were left behind when the perpetrator removed the victim from the
location.&nbsp; Perhaps the rapist hadn’t
meant to leave them behind but something distracted him and he got out as
quickly as possible.&nbsp; Or leaving the
pants behind was simply part of his behavior.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pornographic picture must have
been for the rapist’s own stimulation as he fondled a small child.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the only explanation I
have ever been able to come up with that makes sense.&nbsp; I will always be bothered by what I found,
for I won’t really ever know what happened in that vile covert.</p>
